// Design a Java program to fulfill the requirements of XYZ Art Gallery. Implement the visitor management system using TreeMap to store visitor details. Ensure that visitor entries are sorted alphabetically by their names. Include functionalities to add visitor details, check if the hourly limit is reached, create a new TreeMap for the next hour if needed, and display visitor details.

// Your program should also have a loading factor feature such that when the visitor count reaches 80% of the hourly limit, create a new TreeMap for the next hour.
